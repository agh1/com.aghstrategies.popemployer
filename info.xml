  <name>Populate Employer for Anonymous Users</name>
  <description>When an anonymous visitor fills profiles and other forms having email address and employer fields, this extension searches for an individual with a matching email address and populates the form with his or her employer.  This requires granting the "access AJAX API" permission to anonymous users.</description>
