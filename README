Populate Employer for Anonymous Users (CiviCRM Extension)

When an anonymous visitor fills profiles and other forms having email address and 
employer fields, this extension searches for an individual with a matching email 
address and populates the form with his or her employer.  This requires granting 
the "access AJAX API" permission to anonymous users.

This is meant to address problems in CRM-10128 (leaving the employer blank on a 
profile will unset your current employer if you have one) and problems of people 
typing organization names different ways.
